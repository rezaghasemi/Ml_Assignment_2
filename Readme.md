This is the second coding assignment for the introduction to machine learning algorithm by Lili Mou.


Utils.py:

Function generate() takes as input "A" or "B", it returns X, t.
X is two dimensional vectors, t is the list of labels (0 or 1).    

Function plot_data(X, t, w=None, bias=None, is_logistic=False, figure_name=None)
takes as input paris of (X, t) , parameter w, and bias. 
If you are plotting the decision boundary for a logistic classifier, set "is_logistic" as True
"figure_name" specifies the name of the saved diagram.
